                    <span className="term-heading">AML </span>
                    - AML is an acronym for “Anti-Money Laundering.” AML regulations
                    were originally designed around traditional centralized banking
                    systems, and have since needed to adapt to account for Bitcoin and
                    other cryptocurrency transactions.

                    <span className="term-heading">AML Bitcoin </span>
                    - AML Bitcoin is a relatively new cryptocurrency aimed at
                    fully complying with US regulatory authorities. Its proponents claim
                    that it is fully compliant with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy
                    Act, and the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. Since it meets the
                    standards of US regulatory agencies, AML Bitcoin also complies with
                    many other government regulations from around the world.

                    <span className="term-heading">Arbitrage </span>
                    - Arbitrage is a technical term from the world of finance and
                    economics. It is a form of trading that capitalizes on the price
                    difference between two or more markets. For example, a trader practicing
                    arbitrage might buy a currency in one market and sell it in another
                    market at a higher price, earning a profit from a temporary difference
                    in prices. The difference between the prices is called a spread.

                    <span className="term-heading">ASICs </span>
                    - ASICS are application-specific integrated circuits designed to
                    process only a specific kind of application. An ASIC is programmed to do
                    one thing only, and it does this much faster and more efficiently than
                    multi-purpose processors. Bitcoin mining ASICs are tailored to mining
                    bitcoins quickly and efficiently.

                    <span className="term-heading">ATH </span>
                    - ATH is an acronym for “all-time high.” In cryptocurrency discussions,
                    ATH refers to the highest valuation reached to date for a particular
                    currency.

                      prices, encouraging selling. Bearish is used to describe speculators
                      and analysts who have an outlook that assumes falling prices are likely
                      to occur in the near future. The opposite of bearish is bullish.
